# sorealtravel_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This project I took on to practice and get familiar with the dart programming langauge and the flutter framework by
building a simple travel application for Uncle Fanus to make it easier to book tours and for him to manage his tours.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
